# We need to include a full business bank account number and full business bank routing number in the nacha file we send to Continental bank: [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-118|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-118|smart-link] 
# We need to include a full business bank account number and full business bank routing number in the borrower payment information we set up in Peach: [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-341|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-341|smart-link] 
# We need to be able to send the full personal bank account number and full personal bank routing number to peach in the future as borrower payment information if the business defaults.

*Current functionality:*

Currently when an MX bank account is connected, we only receive a partial account number and a null routing number.

Then when we create the nacha file, we hit these additional endpoints to get the full account information ([https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-537|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-537|smart-link]): 

[https://docs.mx.com/api#verification_mx_widgets_list_account_numbers_by_account|https://docs.mx.com/api#verification_mx_widgets_list_account_numbers_by_account] 

[https://docs.mx.com/api#verification_mx_widgets_list_account_numbers_by_member|https://docs.mx.com/api#verification_mx_widgets_list_account_numbers_by_member] 

We believe these endpoints provide both the full account number and the full routing number.

*Problems:*

# When user tries to complete loan, they get a {{Some MX properties not set}} error due to the null routing number and thus cannot create their loan.
# The full account number and routing number are not available to send to Peach when we create the borrower payment method according to [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-341|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-341|smart-link] 

*Possible suggestions:*

# Hit the above endpoints at the time the MX bank account is connected and store the full account number and routing number in our database
# Allow the loan to be created even if the routing number is null in our database rather than giving the {{Some MX properties not set}} error, and hit the endpoints to retrieve the information when we:
## Create the nacha file (already happening for account number but not sure about routing number)
## Create borrower payment method in Peach (not happening currently)
## Send personal borrower payment info to Peach in the future (need to confirm this will still be available up to 5 years in the future).

*Additional notes:*

# May make [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-566|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-566|smart-link] unnecessary if this solves the routing number issue.
# Whether we stay on MX or not ([https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-554|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-554|smart-link]) will be determined based on efficacy of this fix.",,Kaela Worthen,,,,61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PAINT-4,Create Loan,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i00060:r5zin0i,,,,,,Resurrection üê£ (19),,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ö –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é,,

Simple as that. Or maybe even to add current routing number to be sure that admin has not messed anything up while saving.

However, we are incorrectly applying this to all phone numbers on all owners.

So in this case, user ID {{ce728b7a-0417-4c33-abff-bc155dc82ae5}} / email {{ron.integrity@outlook.com}} had created an account using SMS MFA.

He was trying to add his co-owner, user ID {{61f8c11f-96a9-43d0-9715-e0e35a425adc}} / email {{misc4sale@hotmail.com}} (now deleted).

The user doing the editing had SMS MFA set up on their account so they should not be able to edit their own phone number. However, they DID need to add a phone number for the second owner, but they couldn‚Äôt, because we incorrectly locked that phone number field as well.

Session recording here: [https://fsty.io/v/8LPyCuKc|https://fsty.io/v/8LPyCuKc|smart-link] 

The user who was unable to have a phone number added had {{""phoneNumberChangeDisabled"":false}} in the db, so I‚Äôm not sure why it was showing as locked.

Current logic seems to be:

* If owner has SMS MFA set up, they cannot edit any phone numbers (incorrect).

Logic should be:

* Any owners *with* SMS MFA set up canNOT have their phone number edited, regardless of who is doing the editing.
* Any owners *without* SMS MFA set up CAN have their phone number edited, regardless of who is doing the editing.
* Basically, just follow the rules of {{phoneNumberChangeDisabled}} and don‚Äôt care about what user is logged in.

From our bank partner, who is sometimes ending up blocking some of our emails:

{quote}It looks like the emails from ‚Äò[getpaintbrush.com|http://getpaintbrush.com]‚Äô are failing all DNS checks.  Most emails on our ‚ÄòAllow List‚Äô have to pass at least one check, and those that fail all still end up in quarantine.  Here is the setting explanation:

Emails from an address in the allow list with enforced authentication will have to pass at least one of the DNS checks ‚Äì e.g. DMARC, SPF, or DKIM ‚Äì to be delivered, skipping subsequent scans. If an email from the allowed address with enforced authentication fails all the DNS checks, then Sophos Email will ignore the allow list entry and subject the email to subsequent scans.

By definition DMARC protection is to help prevent email fraud and establish domain trust

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication protocol. It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email spoofing. The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks, phishing email, email scanning.

If you use a relay device or email is sent from another domain but has [getpaintbrush.com|http://getpaintbrush.com] on it, you can get this

Plaid is extremely similar to MX but actually works. They are the dominant player in the space and have been around for a long time.

*Option 2: Use a bank connection aggregator*

There are a few aggregators that have come into play recently. The risk with these is that they are new, which means we could run into issues with them. But the pros are very compelling‚Äîthey allow us to interface with Plaid + MX + Finicity + others over time, while we only use one API, and they normalize the bank data from all of those for us, and balance the connections‚Äîi.e. if Plaid has the best connection to Mercury it will use that one, but if Finicity is the only one that has a connection to Continental Bank it will use that one, etc.

It initially went into manual review, however, then it went into an {{insufficient_data}} for the user journey and {{docs_requested}} for the business state. This is reflected in the database Alloy table and behaving correctly in the product. 

However, the {{Alloyapplicationstatus}} in Intercom is still listed as {{manual_review}}, which means that we did not trigger the emails to go out to the user to notify them that they needed to add any more information. The status should have updated to {{insufficient_data}} since that is what we are showing in the product as well.

Statuses are also not getting updated correctly once a loan is approved. For example, the application with jaToken {{JA-1DmOMx8sSKAntjItc5fp}} has uploaded docs and now been approved, and the database has both the business and owner as approved, but Intercom shows it still as stuck at the upload docs stage.

* If MX returns multiple accounts, remove any that are not supported (loan, credit card, etc.), then:
** If there is only one account remaining that is checking or savings, we just connect it (page gets reloaded RIGHT AFTER user chooses radiobutton, we do not add any logic to save button) and do not show any radio buttons or NEW errors
** If there are multiple accounts that we can support, show yellow error {{Please choose which account you would like us to use, or link a different bank here.}} ‚ÄúLink a different bank here‚Äù should be underlined and clear all MX info and lets the user to start the process from scratch.

This task will take a decent amount of time, because:

* We will need to integrate with an identity provider (onelogin or similar)
* Integration with an identity provider means changing logic of our authentication on paintbrush (and the fact that we have MFA does not make it easier)
* Identity providers are not free but we need to talk to them in person to find out how much it really costs, it seems like onelogin says: 4 dollars per user per month which seems a lot: [https://www.onelogin.com/product/pricing|https://www.onelogin.com/product/pricing|smart-link]
* Even though we have peach APIs for SSO, it seems that we will need more info than that, meaning that we will have to spend some time with Peach implementing it properly which adds complexity as well
* All in all, a lot of professionals online claim that if you really want to have SSO, it is not worth it to have only for 1 external log in, it is more logical when you have 3-4+ external logins to utilize SSO to the fullest

To sum up, we are looking at 20+ storypoints together with integration.

The peach process has been growing a lot during the paintbrush application development and now is a good time to introduce the process of handling potential errors in a proper manner.

Required steps for successful Paintbrush loan creation (200 response on {{POST}} to {{/loans}} endpoint):

* Create Peach Borrower. If the borrower already exists - skip this step
* Create Borrower Contact Info in Peach, details in [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-190|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-190|smart-link]
* Create Peach User IS OPTIONAL, hence can be removed from {{/loans}} endpoint and moved to the queue
* Create Loan in {{loans}} table in our DB. (make sure that rolling back {{await Loan.create()}} transactions will not break sequences in SQL, and every time loan is created it will have unique name, even after rollback)
* Create Peach Loan is REQUIRED. Fetch loans by company.peachId, if there is a loan created in peach - skip this step. Assign {{peachLoanId}} to {{loan}} row in our database.
* Create Payment Method can be moved out from endpoint to the queue.
* Creating agreements ({{SetupAutopay}} and {{CreateAgreements}} services) can also be moved to the queue



Queue:

By the time queue task is executed, we have Peach Borrower created in peach, Contact Info is attached to every user in the company, Loan is created in our DB, as well as Peach Loan is created.

# {{CreateUser}} service. Will create users in peach.
# {{CreatePaymentMethod}} service creates a Payment Instrument entity in peach, which is also used in {{SetupAutopay}} service => SetupAutopay depends on this step.
## Making note here‚Äîcurrently if this step fails, we still create the loan in Peach but do not save it in our DB, which can lead to the loan being created as many times as the user clicks the button. We need to make sure we either have the checks in place before the loan is created, or that we save the loan being created even if we show this error.
# {{CreateAgreements}} service creates document descriptors in peach. Also in the future this service probably will be responsible for pdf generation and upload.
# {{SetupAutopay}} service uses Payment Method from step 2 and creates autopay agreement



We can run services 1, 2, 3 in parallel.



P.S. Every day at 5PM all yesterday‚Äôs loans are activated in peach. This turns on autopay in peach => by the time {{activateLoans}} task runs, we need to make sure that {{SetupAutopay}} was already succesfully run.

Are the queued jobs going to start immediately after the required jobs are completed? Or is this going to be a queue that only runs once a day or something? 2-4 are fine if they only run once a day, but 1 needs to happen fairly immediately since we prompt the user to try to log into their borrower portal (Peach) immediately after we create the loan, and they won‚Äôt be able to do that if the user has not been created.

Yes, we wanted to try not to affect the process of loan creation itself. So we will not ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù any functionality because of this change, it‚Äôs just a technical improvement, which will make it easier technically to handle potential errors, debug different steps. Right now everything is happening inside ‚Äú/loans‚Äù endpoint call, so if something goes wrong.- we end up in a state of DB where it‚Äôs not possible for user to retry it + user has to wait a lot of time while making this endpoint call, and if only one of those things goes wrong - everything goes wrong.

For that we would like to separate these processes in order for them to be more transparent and easy to debug to us, and make these processes more failure-proof.

The problem is that our logic is designed to use only one account. 

How to fix: when user connects >1 account, we throw an error on front-end:

‚ÄùLoan funds can only be deposited into a single business bank account. Please +try again+ and only choose one account this time. Or you can add another bank instead.‚Äù

Error color: RED

Logic in text: Try again will refresh the page and open MX modal to add account + wipe an existing info which we got from MX.

If you are pressing next on any agreement except autopay agreement, the application will not let you go to next page due to validation.

 but after discussions it became clear that all errors do not need it, because for most of them, there is nothing even connected yet, and for the rest it can break the logic. So we have decided to make it easier and more unified: we will add the +Or add another bank account+ to almost all errors where it makes sense, so that users can add another bank if they want to. Thus, we are not completely blocking them.

Answers from Alloy:

# It‚Äôs not yet 100% clear what is a ""blackbox"" in the iovation doc and how to store it, and also at what point it should be collected and sent? 
{color:#0747a6}You don't need to store anywhere. You would, however, collect it for each applicant, and then pass it along to Alloy{color}
# Should we collect this data and submit it on every form? 
{color:#0747a6}You do not need to collect it on every form. You collect it once and pass that information to Alloy. Nothing should change about their device from page to page. {color}

We want to track every ‚Äòstatus‚Äô field change in MX table. So every time the status changes - we will create a Mixpanel event (which will be duplicated in Intercom automatically).

There is a nuance that‚Äôs not quite clear to me though:

both mixpanel and intercom events are tied to a specific user id. So we can‚Äôt send events on behalf of a company, it always has to be a user. Should we use a personal guarantor user id for events of connecting both personal and bank account?

I.e. status changes from ‚ÄúCHALLENGED‚Äù to ‚ÄúDENIED‚Äù on the Business Bank Account, the personal guarantor of that company will receive mixpanel event ‚ÄúMX_BUSINESS_STATUS_CHANGE‚Äù with a {‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúDENIED‚Äù} property. This will be propagated to the intercom on the same user level. The same will be with Personal Bank Account, with the only difference of event name.



Is that the desired outcome?","12/–¥–µ–∫/22 10:22 PM;61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52;[~accountid:62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818] ah good to know. are we able to tie them to the user who took the action of connecting the bank account? it will most likely be the personal guarantor bank account, but for example:

* personal guarantor connects personal bank account: tie MX personal bank account statuses to personal guarantor user ID
* second owner connects business bank account: tie MX business bank account statuses to second owner user ID

If not possible, then let‚Äôs always connect to the personal guarantor user ID.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ,,

We would like to add all the below information to the *company* in intercom, regardless of what type of code it is and if it was related to an owner or the business.

There are a few possible ways we could do this:

# Create a tag for each decline code: [https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/create-and-update-tags|https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/create-and-update-tags] and then tag the company with each decline code: [https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/tag-companies|https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/tag-companies]
# Add each decline code as a custom company attribute that can be true/false/null: [https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/create-or-update-company|https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/create-or-update-company]
# ??

We also have the same issue with the score factors related to the credit score.

Finally, we need the credit score that was pulled on the application.

üîî Logic description after planning (+notes to QAs):

!image-20221024-123240.png|width=50%!


After discussion it has been decided that we need to track Alloy decline codes to Intercom on server side.

In Intercom, we want to be able to know every time a user takes action on their application. This event should be triggered either:

* every time a database change is made to the application before it has been submitted, 
AND/OR
* every time a user clicks save/submit within the application.

While these don‚Äôt measure the exact same thing, they are fairly close in terms of what we‚Äôre trying to assess for this purpose‚Äîuser working on the application‚Äîso either will work based on whichever is easiest to track.

[~accountid:62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818] is proposing to connect intercom to these mixpanel events and send intercom events whenever mixpanel events are triggered on these buttons.

What do you think about this? or you want it to be independent?

P.S. This is will be easier to implement and to test","12/–æ–∫—Ç/22 7:14 PM;61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52;[~accountid:5a97faed1df57331bfe56e3e] [~accountid:62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818] I think this could work great; however, there are several different events in Mixpanel that make up the {{application_progress}} event we‚Äôre trying to save in Intercom. Would it be possible to consolidate them into one event in Intercom, or would we end up with a lot of different ones?

For example, in Mixpanel, we have the following events:

* Edit Business Information
* Edit Owner Information
* Edit Owners List
* Edit Income
* Submit Application
* Information Added
* Edit Loan Terms
* Edit Income Guarantee
* Edit Autopay Agreement
* Edit Business Bank Account
* Edit Personal Bank Account
* Complete Loan

Ideally in Intercom, we would have one event:

* event name: application_progress
** metadata: mixpanel event name (Edit Business Information, Submit Application, Edit Business Bank Account, etc.)
** metadata: user ID
** metadata: company ID
** metadata: timestamp

Alternatively, rather than trying to build for this specific use case, we could just send all Mixpanel events to Intercom automatically with all their metadata attached, and that could be super helpful in addressing this use case and some of the other tickets as well.","13/–æ–∫—Ç/22 11:16 AM;62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818;[~accountid:61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52] thanks for your clarifications üôÇ

For example:

* User already filled out self-assessment form but did not complete the step of creating their password. We email them and ask them to finish creating their account and applying for their loan. We would like to direct them to a page where they can do just create a login without having to start the self-assessment all over again. (This is the primary use case.)
* Owner 1 adds Owner 2 to an application. Owner 2 should be able to create an account to help fill out the application without having to fill out the self-assessment form again. (This is currently being solved by just making them fill out the self-assessment form and is likely a small edge case, so not that big of a deal.)

Suggested UX:

Error handling logic:


* If email already exists in DB and password is not set ‚Üí Let the user set a password and user has to be redirected to our new and secure log in flow (with MFA)
* If email already exists in DB and password is set ‚Üí show the warning which we already have on ‚Äúget-started‚Äú page:

We have a question: now, the logic combines business address1 and address2 in one string and compares it with the address field that MX provides us. Should we treat the address1 and address2 as two independent addresses? 
Also, we think that fuzzy match should be applied to the address field as well.
We think that this feature may cause issues because the owner may use different emails, phone numbers and addresses in MX and our app.","01/–Ω–æ—è/22 9:07 PM;61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52;Yes, let‚Äôs combine address1 and address2 in one string to compare with MX address field.

The status of the loan agreement, personal guaranty, autopay agreement, business bank account, and personal bank account do not matter on this page. They could be complete, in progress, or to do, and it will not affect if we show the warning or if we expire the loan.

The only logic that matters is when the application was approved, and if the loan was created.

The loan is created when:

* The user clicks the final {{Complete loan}} button and then click it again in the confirmation modal
* We create the loan in our DB
* We create the loan in Peach
* We send the NACHA file to Continental to fund the loan (or put it in the queue to be funded)

If that has not happened, then the approval is at risk of expiration and should show the warning or expire as shown above.

Some thoughts:

# Let‚Äôs use the {{paintbrushApplicationStatus}} in Intercom instead of {{applicationStatus}} and switch it from {{create-loan}} to {{expired}}

{quote}Various security headers were found to be missing from the web application that could lead to clickjacking. Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on a framed page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is ""hijacking"" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. This site is vulnerable to clickjacking as seen in Appendix 2 and 5. For this reason, it is recommended to set several security Headers.

¬†

*Recommendation:* Sending the proper X-Frame-Options in HTTP response headers that instruct the browser to not allow framing from other domains.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *X-Frame-Options*: DENY: It completely denies to be loaded in frame/iframe.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *X-Frame-Options*: SAMEORIGIN: It allows only if the site which wants to load has the same origin.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *X-Frame-Options*: ALLOW-FROM URL: It grants a specific URL to load itself in an iframe. However, not all browsers may support this.

¬†

Additionally, employing defensive code in the UI can ensure that the current frame is the most top-level window.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *X-XSS-Protection*: This response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting attacks.¬†

¬†

This header is mainly used for legacy browsers, so if there is no need to support legacy browsers, Content-Security-Policies should be implemented instead for an extra layer of defense.¬†{quote}",,Kaela Worthen,,,,61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PAINT-291,Make sure the platform is super duper secure,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hzzvfq:zzxkt3zmtm36,,,,,,Salud! ü•É (16),,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ,,

*Recommendation:* The information in the loan agreements seems like it should be indisputable and immutable to better enforce a binding contract. Client-side checks can easily be bypassed.

{quote}Session cookie values are preserved before and after authentication. This allows for attackers to obtain sessions and set them on client devices to obtain a valid session if they login. For this reason, it is recommended to either refresh session information after authentication or enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

*Recommendation:* While it is not a vulnerability to retain session information before and after authentication, it can lead to session compromises. Refresh a user‚Äôs session information after they authenticate. Alternatively, enforce full HSTS. HSTS is a web directive that directs how user agents and web browsers handle a connection.

From Northcross:

{quote}Session cookie, _connect.sid,_ does not contain secure attributes. This could allow for the cookie-based attacks as seen in Appendix 6. For this reason, it is recommended to secure session cookies by setting the _secure_ and _samesite_ cookie attributes.

*Recommendation:* While it is not a vulnerability to disregard these flags in the current production environment, future vulnerabilities could lead to compromised sessions. The current session cookie, _connect.sid_, is sent to the end user over an encrypted channel, but that does not reduce the risk of exfiltration of the cookie. Currently, the _HttpOnly_ flag is set. It prevents access to cookie values with JavaScript to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This cookie is _missing_ the +_secure_+ and _samesite_ attributes. *It is recommended to set both the* *_secure_* *attribute to* *_true_* *and the* *_samesite_* *attribute to* *_strict_**.*

The _secure_ attribute ensures the cookie will only be sent through a secure channel. Although this site uses https, there might be a future vulnerability that could allow for unsecure exfiltration of the cookie. It is best to enforce the secure attribute in all use cases for https sites.

The _samesite_ attribute ensures the cookie is not sent from cross-origin requests to prevent cross-site forgery attacks (CSRF). Set the _samesite_ attribute to _strict_.

The _samesite_ attribute contains three possible values: _none_, _lax_, and _strict_. _None_ will allow sending the cookie from all contexts. _Lax_ allows the cookie to be sent with a first-party context and from GET requests initiated by third-party websites. _Strict_ only allows the cookie to be sent in a first-party context only.{quote}",,Kaela Worthen,–ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å ,,,61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PAINT-291,Make sure the platform is super duper secure,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i009f0:,,,,,,Seductive UX üòª(15),,,,,0.0,,,,,,,2022-10-06 13:54:06.832,{},06/–æ–∫—Ç/22 4:54 PM;5a97faed1df57331bfe56e3e;Probably fixed in [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-375|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-375|smart-link],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ,,

Dima and I got confused with recaptcha hierarchy in google cloud. And after checking everything it appears that recaptcha has to be managed using this link: [+https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin+|https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin]

You will see all possible recaptchas there after admin adds your email.

A valid email address and 2 boxes must be checked in order for the {{unlock account}} button to be able to be clicked.

The {{additional notes}} section is optional/not required to submit the form.

Ideally upon successful unlock, a toast message (üîß DISCUSS: most likely we will implement just yellow warning which we already have designed, because toast message might take extra tome) should appear saying it was successful, and the form should be wiped.

If it was unsuccessful, the form should not be wiped, and an error should appear on the page.

Errors:

* There is no such email in DB: ‚ÄúSuch email does not exist‚Äú
* User did not check at least 2 boxes: ‚ÄúAt least 2 boxes have to be chosen‚Äú
* If the request does not pass for some other reason: most likely server error which we already have

Notes from Northcross:

{quote}There is currently no lockout mechanism for logins. No lockout mechanisms create the opportunity to launch brute-force attacks on user passwords. For this reason, it is recommended to implement various measures that help restrict and eliminate brute-force attacks on user passwords.

*Recommendation*: Account lockout mechanisms include protections for user logins that restrict how and when a user can login. These include:

* Implement a lockout mechanism for successive password guess attempts.
* Implement an unlock mechanism for locked accounts.

*General Guidelines:*

Apply account unlock mechanisms depending on the risk level. In order from lowest to highest assurance:
* Enforce Time-based lockout and unlock based on IP.
* Enforce Time-based lockout and unlock.
* Implement Self-service unlock (sends unlock email to registered email address).
* Enforce a manual administrator unlock.
* Enforce a manual administrator unlock with positive user identification.

Manually by an administrator: this is the most secure lockout method, but may cause inconvenience to users and take up the administrator‚Äôs ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù time.

UPD(!):  Currently, the users get blocked after 5 attempts.
If a user has more than 5 incorrect attempts within 24 hours, they should be locked out of their account for 36 hours. This lockout should be both client-side and server-side.

A warning should appear on the account page when they try to attempt to login each time after the fifth attempt.

After this task has been merged to master, all previous passwords have stopped working. 

If you need to access old account, there are 2 workarounds (you will need direct access to DB to make it work)

Workaround 1:


# Create new user with known password
# Go to the DB
# Copy the hash of the password of this user
# Paste this hash to an old account of the user you need access to
# Log in with ‚Äúold‚Äú user with the ‚Äúknown‚Äú password you created for new user



Workaround 2:

# Run a command 
{noformat}hashPassword('somePassword').then(console.log);{noformat}

2. Then copy this hash and paste it to the needed account in DB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ,,

This task was forked from a bigger task [https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-63|https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-63|smart-link] 

After conversations with Alloy it appeared that SDK does not have the last required update to handle our requests.
Comment from Caroline: 
‚ÄúThere is a new version of our SDK that's set to be released this month that's compatible with multi-entity journey applications, so even if you resolve the first issue you'd still likely run into a processing error. I apologize for the mixup here - I had actually thought that this update had already been released, but after checking internally it's actually slated for August 30th (with some other functionality to make implementing the SDK even easier, too\!).‚Äú

(!) New version of SDK directions are after this line. Old directions have been moved to comments for reference just in case.



To first recap on what's changed about our SDK in this version:

* In the older version of our SDK, all configuration settings had to be set on the initialization parameters when triggering the SDK in your front-end code,¬†when loading the SDK. With the Alloy's latest version, all of the following settings now live within the Alloy dashboard on the Doc-V workflow under the 'SDK Config' section:
** *documents*
** *validationPreChecks*
** *forceMobile*
** *selfie*
** *evaluationData* (this is not configured in the Alloy dashboard, but it is no longer required to set on init for the SDK if you're using Journeys).
* The new version of the SDK does not currently accept an input for the *entityToken* or *externalEntityId*.
** This means that for a multi-entity Journey where 2+ entities need to submit documents, the SDK will prompt the applicant to select which entity within the application that they are uploading documents for. This looks like the following when multiple entities in the journey are in a pending_documents state:

!Screen Shot 2022-09-07 at 15.28.51.png|width=524,height=393!

** After we spoke this AM, I confirmed with our Product team that we are planning on releasing *an update to support specifying the entity upon initializing the SDK in the next 3 weeks*. The implementation of this in the new SDK version will be very similar to (possibly even the exact same as) how it works in the legacy SDK version, i.e., by using an init param.

Some additional notes:

* You can use the same¬†[npm package here|https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alloyidentity/web-sdk], but will need to upgrade to the latest version (right now this is 0.2.12). The docs on the npm package are not updated for the new SDK, but most of it still applies:
** You can use the same alloy.init(), alloy.open(), and alloy.close() functions, and also follow along with the same React snippet at the bottom
** As already mentioned, not all of the initialization parameters listed are relevant
** The callback function response will be different - it will more closely align with the response you'd see for a Journey Application via Alloy's API

(!) UPDATE ABOUT NPM:

The NPM package version that you should use is actually [0.2.13|https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alloyidentity/web-sdk] (08.09.2022), which was pushed today
** You'll need to also include another param, *isNext*, when calling alloy.init(). You can default this to true. So your init params would look something like this (with a different Journey token than what's shown):

!Screen Shot 2022-09-08 at 07.47.04.png|width=806,height=260!
* The parameters passed into alloy.init() should include:
** *key* - you can use the same SDK key that Alloy provided a couple weeks ago. If you need me to resend, please let me know\!
** *journeyToken* - the journey token Paintbrush is using, which is: J-bjXz4XVGyyyxA9uGFDAP
** *journeyApplicationToken* - the JA token for the application where 1+ entities are in pending_documents
** *production* - should be set to false until Paintbrush is ready to go live

Principles that should be used to create a log:
Who?
What is a user doing?
Where is it occurring from?
When did it occur?
Why? (did not log in - typed the username incorrectly 5 times )","01/—Å–µ–Ω/22 3:22 PM;62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818;[~accountid:62c58aa740923988ba0a890a] there is an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù table in ‚Äúaudit‚Äù schema (NOT ‚Äúpublic‚Äù where all other tables are)

 for every change in any of DB tables via any of the endpoints - you will get a new record in audit table indicating who made this changed and what changed values were, and what table changed and so on.

Explanation: Currently you can see the changes which our app is doing in DB. Similarly we will be able to track if someone else has made any changes. We just need to decide who will have access to prod DB, create distinguishable logins for them and watch how anyone makes any change in AWS üëå

It means that we should send an activation request at some point in the flow. 
Right now the loans are created with {{pending}} status.  The Peach representative advised setting the status of the loan to {{originated}} during the creation for reducing the number of API calls ‚ÄúWhen the loan is created, it can be created in the {{originated}} state.¬† This will make it so the loan can be created, and then activated when the funds are dispersed.‚Äù 

Loan activation request: [https://sandboxdocs.peach.finance/tag/Loans#operation/peach.people.loans.handlers.loan_activate|https://sandboxdocs.peach.finance/tag/Loans#operation/peach.people.loans.handlers.loan_activate|smart-link] 

(!) The details of the loan can‚Äôt be changed if it has {{originated}} status. From documentation:
‚ÄùOnce the loan status changes to {{originated}} attributes of {{atOrigination}} object become read-only and cannot be updated.‚Äù

{color:#4c9aff}How to test Peach flow{color}:

1) All the steps of the loan application should be completed (business info, owner info, income history)

2) All the agreements should be signed, business  and personal bank accounts should be added

3) You should be logged in. You should find your session ID. It can be found in your browser: Right Mouse Button click -> Inspect ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí {{connect.sid}} ‚Üí you should copy the whole value of  {{connect.sid}} 
Example: {{s%3A71Bcz7vQF4JgCGG0cxzVfIbdj0Z1La-w.oKRT9X535112GF5ML6kV0lxCAKHTQlcuJNF1%2BQcPGQ4}}

4) You should create borrowers. To do it, you should replace {{YOUR_SESSION_ID}} with the value from step 3 and import the request using Postman and then send it:

# open postman.
# click *import* tab on the top left side.
# select the *raw text tab*.
# paste the raw text, then click *continue*.
# confirm the *name* , *format* and *Import as*
# if step *5*. is correct, click *import*.

{noformat}curl --location --request POST 'https://demo.getpaintbrush.com/api/v1//peach/borrowers' \
--header 'Cookie: connect.sid=YOUR_SESSION_ID' \
--data-raw ''{noformat}

In the response, you will see 

{
    ""data"": {},
    ""status"": 1
}

5) You can check the list of the borrowers. To do it, you should import the request using Postman and send it:

{noformat}curl --location --request GET 'https://demo.getpaintbrush.com/api/v1//peach/borrowers' \{noformat}

In the response, you will see the full list of the borrowers. 

6) *activation request will be here once implemented*

7) The loan should be available in Peach Dashboard under the account of your company.

However, since everything is completed, I should see the prompt telling me that everything is ready to submit.

As we understand, all transactions should have unique trace numbers. For instance, there is an ACH file with two transactions: 0124003070000001 and 0124003070000002. The next file should have 0124003070000003 transactions in it. Is it right?

FYI about testing about emails (most likely we will not have such issues on prod, so this is ONLY about testing):


Sometimes if you are using same emails you might get the error {""message"": ""collision detected"",     ""status"": 400} because in Peach email has to be unique. This might happen because we sometimes clear the DB and after that what might seem for us as a unique user will not be a unique user for Peach. 


","19/—Å–µ–Ω/22 4:43 PM;5a97faed1df57331bfe56e3e;[~accountid:61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52] 

We need a strategy how to handle not unique emails, phones in peach.

Emails are not an issue, emails are unique per user in our app and we do not allow users to create an account with the same email.

BUT, currently we do allow to use same phone numbers for different accounts. And if user sends data to peach with the same phone number, the loan will just not be created in peach because Peach returns ""message"": ""collision detected""


So the question is, in terms of business logic:

To take advantage of it, we need to install a javascript snippet on our site.

This is their explanation of how to set it up:

NeuroID is a simple JS installation. It usually takes engineers an afternoon to complete the integration. The integration is often tagged onto existing sprints and waiting for the deployment window to production is the hard part that usually takes the longest. The detailed integration steps are found here: [https://neuro-id.readme.io/docs/quickstart|https://neuro-id.readme.io/docs/quickstart] and here is a video walking through the integration: [https://vimeo.com/717977252|https://vimeo.com/717977252]

Specifically, here is an overview of the deployment process:

# Engineer typically performs the integration on localhost or a dev environment
## Add data-neuro-label attribute to the required input fields
## Load and start the JS (typically just adding the provided script snippet to the header
## Send the user ID (Alloy ID) on whatever page it becomes available
## Stop the JS if required. NID does not required stopping the JS
# Engineer confirms with NID that the data looks correct after walking through a single application
# Deploy the integration to production

*Paintbrush-specific notes:*

* We will need to be able to identify which owner pages are the same as the person who is logged in vs which ones are owners that are different from the person logged in
* We will customize {{nid('start', [page_identifier]);}} on each page so that the page_identifier applies to each of the below pages
** business_information
** owners_list (page summarizing the owners view)
** applicant_information (page where you‚Äôre editing a specific owner, and it‚Äôs the same owner as the person who is logged in)
** additional_owner_information (page where you‚Äôre editing a specific owner, and it‚Äôs a _different_ owner from the person who is logged in)
** income_history
* {{nid('setUserId', [value]);}} is how users will be identified; we will use their Paintbrush user ID for [value]
* Only when the user submits the application, we should call the application submit function:
{{nid('applicationSubmit'); nid('sendData');}}
** We should NOT call the application submit function on any of the business info, owner info, or income history pages when they hit the save button.
* For the applicant_information page, where the owner information being edited is the same as the information about the person logged in, we should label all fields that have the behavior column as {{Known Field}}
* For all other pages, including business_information and additional_owner_information, we should tag each field as {{secondary_address_all_fields}} with a {{--}} after to then label it uniquely. For example:
** {{secondary_address_all_fields--businessAddress1}}
** {{secondary_address_all_fields--businessAddress2}}
** {{secondary_address_all_fields--businessEIN}}
** {{secondary_address_all_fields--additionalOwnerPhone}}

It means that every user will be tracked on every page by default.
If we want to change it - you need to disable autostart here: [https://neuro-id.analytics.neuro-id.com/v2/app/settings/configs|https://neuro-id.analytics.neuro-id.com/v2/app/settings/configs|smart-link]

And just a few additional comments on how integration is implemented for now (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong with smth):


* NeuroID starts collecting data ONLY WHEN logged in user lands on one of these pages - business-info, owner-info, income-history
* NeuroID stops tracking without application submission ONLY WHEN user logs out
* NeuroID submits application ONLY WHEN ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù button on ‚Äú/loan-application/submit‚Äù is pressed, and then stops tracking (no further actions will be tracked)","07/–Ω–æ—è/22 4:14 PM;62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818;‚ö†Ô∏è Testing notes:

Since we don‚Äôt have access to the dashboard yet - the only way to test it is through NeuroID logs in the browser console. In order to enable these logs you need to set environment variable {{REACT_APP_VERBOSE_ANALYTICS}} to {{true}} on an environment that you are testing. In addition, you have to add environment variable {{REACT_APP_NEUROID_SCRIPT=nid-debut221}}  to {{app}} and {{REACT_APP_NEUROID_SCRIPT=nid-debut221-test}} to every other env.

Also make sure that all {{input}} tags have correct {{data-neuro-label}} attribute values (known and unknown fields)","07/–Ω–æ—è/22 10:56 PM;61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52;[~accountid:62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818] yes, that logic in your bullet points looks correct to me.

I‚Äôm not too concerned about the tracking starting automatically since there aren‚Äôt really forms that can be submitted on the other pages (i.e. on the loan application page) so maybe we can ask on the call with neuroID if it will cause issues if we leave it enabled or if it would be better to disable.

# Is it weird that we are connecting the business to MX and the PG to MX in different ways? Ie MX id on companies table, but user ID on MX table? Shouldn‚Äôt they be handled consistently?

* Move {{mxPersonalId}} from ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù table to ‚Äúusers‚Äù table. Thus, {{mxPersonalId}} will be connected to a user (to PG if they are one) and {{mxBusinessId}} will be connected to a company in their respective tables

* Starts as regular business loan with 15% interest
* Converts to personal guarantee being repaid at 15% of income
* Person goes into active military duty and loan goes into special state to comply with SCRA legal requirements
* Loan is discharged
* Etc

According to our bank‚Äôs recommendations of lending industry best practices, we should create a new loan each time we change the terms of the loan. However, in order to be able to easily track the history across these new loans being created, we want to:

* Have a short, human-rememberable loan ID
* Be able to know what loans converted into and from which other loans

I‚Äôm suggesting the following loan structure, but open to ideas:

* loan ID stays as is
* NEW FIELD: loan name = 3-digit number + status identifier
* NEW FIELD: converted from: previous loan ID (if any)
* NEW FIELD: converted to: loan ID it changed to (if any)

For example:

1. Status identifier should mean something or it can a random latter?
2. If we user 3 digits + 1 letter we are limited only to 26000 loans (10x10x10x26) which sounds like a lot but there might be some problems after several years when we run out of IDs.

1. Ideally status identifier should be as follows:

* B = business repayment (all loans are in this state by default)
* PG = in personal guarantee repayment (converted to this state manually)
* D = discharged (converted to this state manually)
* SCRA = active service member duty
* may be others in the future that we will need to identify

2. Yeah, 5 digits is totally fine. And/or we can just continue incrementing the number as we start running out, whichever you guys prefer\!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,–ö –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é,,

these business types will always be denied so should never need to be mapped, but just in case:

{{PARTNERSHIP}} = {{""generalPartnership""}}

{{SOLE_PROPRIETORSHIP}} = {{""soleProprietor""}}

so since we only send Peach the approved applications, we should never have to send them a loan that is company type {{CORPORATION}} and industry {{CONTENT_CREATION}} because that application would be denied. similarly, we will never create a loan with business type {{NON_PROFIT}} , {{PARTNERSHIP}} , or {{SOLE_PROPRIETORSHIP}} because their application will be denied. 

just in case though, let‚Äôs do the mappings like this:

* 1 File Header: The first row, with information about the bank the money is coming from
* 2 Batch Header: The second row. In many NACHA files there are multiple batches within a file, but ours will only ever have 1 batch
* 3 Transaction data: Information about how much money to send to whom. There will be one row for each loan originated. Sometimes referred to as Entry data.
* 4 Batch Footer: The row after all the transactions. Summarizes all the transactions in the batch. Sometimes referred to as the Batch Control Record
* 5 File Footer: Row at the bottom with summary of all the information in the file. Since there‚Äôs only one batch in the file, many of this information will be the same as in the batch footer. Sometimes referred to as the File Control Record
* 6 Padding: NACHA files must have rows in multiples of 10, so if there are not enough rows, then a row of 999s (or multiple rows) are added at the very bottom after everything else

Get Fingerprint. Return a 32-bit integer representing the browsers fingerprint.

I have tested signing of agreements in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari (both incognito and default mods) on Mac. 

Also, tested it on Android (Google Chrome, Firefox) and on Safari on IOS. In all the default  cases it works fine. 

Tried changing the orientation and resolution of the screen in Google Chrome (first signature with one resolution and the second with another - it causes error and the agreement can‚Äôt be signed).

But in some cases if the fingerprint differs the agreements still can be signed:

Comment from Kaela:
We should not include all previous loans, ONLY the new loans. the only incrementing is ideally in the trace number ([row 37 in this sheet|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17hQUjRIRabeKWpK00RIRwX6SQ1pXqn_YLDbFWB21DyI/edit#gid=0]), if we can make that increment so that if yesterday we sent a file that had 0124003070000001 and 0124003070000002, today we would send a file that had 0124003070000003 and 0124003070000004

* Mask the phone number which user enters in the format NNN-NNN-NNNN (ex. what it will look like: +1 647-208-7188)
* Do not allow to enter more than 10 digits
* Save only plain numbers to DB









Additional info for reference after this line:

----

Right now we only accept phone numbers with numbers and no special symbols, but many people format their phone numbers with dashes or parentheses (for example, my browser autofilled my phone number with that formatting in it).

This is confusing because we can end up giving an error telling them to enter a valid phone number when they have already entered a valid phone number:

Possible solutions:

* 1st best: We allow parentheses, spaces, and dashes to be typed in, but we strip them out on the backend when saving the phone number. Similarly, if the phone number starts with a 1 or +1, we should strip that out since we don‚Äôt need the country code (we can only accept US applicants right now).
* 2nd best: We don‚Äôt allow them to even enter those characters in on the front end (if they type it, we just ignore it) and have validation that only allows them to enter 10 digits with no additional characters (if they keep typing past 10 characters we just ignore them)
** Bonus if we can automatically show dashes after the numbers for them on the frontend so it‚Äôs visually easier for them to make sure they typed their phone number in correctly xxx-xxx-xxxx



As a user, it would be nice if we automatically formatted the phone number into NNN-NNN-NNNN.

So if I typed 1234567890 we would automatically format it as 123-456-7890.

If I type 123-456-7890 we would also still format it as 123-456-7890 because the dashes would just type over the ones we have pre-formatted.

We would also not allow them to enter more than 10 digits.

This way they can easily see that they have entered the full number and visually distinguish any errors more easily, and make sure that they don‚Äôt run into any formatting problems.

This would not change the formatting on the backend, this would just be how it is visually styled for the user.",,Kaela Worthen,vladislav.chelcov,,,61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52,62f52046f15eecaf50109d14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PAINT-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20/–Ω–æ—è/22 6:16 PM;ug:3dfe0428-f598-41ae-b3a0-3c0a7cbb080e;Paintbrush - Google Chrome 2022-11-20 18-01-23.mp4;https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/38439/Paintbrush+-+Google+Chrome+2022-11-20+18-01-23.mp4,11/–∏—é–ª/22 9:35 PM;ug:04245434-86c8-4f24-916c-3acd5782390a;Screen Shot 2022-07-11 at 12.25.17 PM.png;https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/35018/Screen+Shot+2022-07-11+at+12.25.17+PM.png,11/–∏—é–ª/22 9:35 PM;ug:04245434-86c8-4f24-916c-3acd5782390a;Screen Shot 2022-07-11 at 12.25.54 PM.png;https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/35019/Screen+Shot+2022-07-11+at+12.25.54+PM.png,20/–Ω–æ—è/22 6:16 PM;ug:3dfe0428-f598-41ae-b3a0-3c0a7cbb080e;Screenshot (1).png;https://aleph-one.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/38438/Screenshot+%281%29.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PAINT-3,Application,,,,,,,,,,,vladislav.chelcov,62f52046f15eecaf50109d14,1|hzzvfq:zzxkt3zmtm8x7,,,,,,Seductive UX üòª(15),,,,,5.0,,,,,,,2022-11-20 16:16:34.974,"{build={count=1, dataType=build, failedBuildCount=0, successfulBuildCount=1, unknownBuildCount=0}, repository={count=10, dataType=repository}, json={""cachedValue"":{""errors"":[],""summary"":{""repository"":{""overall"":{""count"":10,""lastUpdated"":""2022-11-21T21:42:08.000+0200"",""dataType"":""repository""},""byInstanceType"":{""GitLab"":{""count"":10,""name"":""GitLab""}}},""build"":{""overall"":{""count"":1,""lastUpdated"":null,""failedBuildCount"":0,""successfulBuildCount"":1,""unknownBuildCount"":0,""dataType"":""build""},""byInstanceType"":{""cloud-providers"":{""count"":1,""name"":""Other providers""}}}}},""isStale"":true}}","20/–Ω–æ—è/22 6:16 PM;62f52046f15eecaf50109d14;[~accountid:62c2c9a2e16ddfe82bdee818]

Scope: 

So ‚Äúin production‚Äú there will be instances when user has to give answers to additional questions from banks. Luckily MX can handle all of that with their modal windows and we just need to receive the response from them like: connected, failed, denied, challenged etc‚Ä¶.

Ideally if we receive this response from MX, this would be solved by adding an error message on the page showing the user they need to verify that bank account and with a link to do so:

!Frame 105.png|width=75%!

Clicking on the link would open the MX modal.

If possible, it would be nice to also change the status to a {{needs more info}} status, but that may be a larger lift.

!Frame 106.png|width=58.333333333333336%!

Once they have answered any additional questions or provided information, if the verification is pending, we would show an information blurb and have the status as {{in progress}}.

!Frame 107.png|width=75%!

* During these verifications (there might be 2 verifications actually with different questions, just like we have with Alloy: checking one info first, if there are additional questions, MX will ask for another info) the step will be ‚ÄúIn progress‚Äú which means that the user cannot submit a loan, because we have this logic already 

We should also create logging in Mixpanel for these events, which should also be transferred into Intercom.

3 phases:

This is true IF there is more income history required. But if there is sufficient income history, it will skip directly to the next phase.

Comment from Kaella in the task [https://ezetech.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-18|https://ezetech.atlassian.net/browse/PAINT-18|smart-link] :









‚ÄùIdeally if they change the personal guarantor we would remove the employment history on the front end since there is a new personal guarantor, and show that this step has not been done. However, on the backend we should KEEP all the employment history tied to the owner it was connected to, in case they switch who the personal guarantor is again, so they don‚Äôt have to reconnect or reupload everything (both to save the user the effort and because there is a connection fee for us each time)‚Äù

Ideally in the short term I would like to see:

* On the table where we store business information, add fields for:

* Bank account holder (tbd)
* Bank account name
* Bank account type
* Bank account number
* Bank account routing
* Transaction monitoring turned on y/n (or if there is some unique identifier/key for this, use that instead and leave null if not turned on)

* On the table where we store owner information, add fields for:

* Bank account holder (tbd)
* Bank account name
* Bank account type
* Bank account number
* Bank account routing
* Transaction monitoring turned on (we won't have to use transaction monitoring for quite a while on personal bank accounts since this will only apply if they switch over to income-driven repayment)
* These fields should only be filled in for the personal guarantor, no other owners

For _now_, we do not need to store the actual transaction data anywhere, but at some point in the future we *will* want to pull that into an admin portal where our team can review transactions.¬†","17/–∏—é–Ω/22 8:11 PM;61fc70a9530d2a007147fb52;[~accountid:5a97faed1df57331bfe56e3e] for now to keep things simple, we will only allow them to connect one account.

How to test: 

* we can start sending over test data whenever we're ready
* they'll let us know manually that they've received files for now, no automated way of confirming

* We generate the data from our DB which can be sent to bank using the creds given above
* We send the data ONLY in CSV using postman request, NOT clicking any button in our UI
* We contact bank directly via email for example and ask them if they have received the data in CSV
* Need to add endpoint in order to test the file format

The format I've been building on for the Argyle input data is mocked up in the Postman collection, but I've attached it as a separate JSON as well. If possible, I was hoping we could get the¬†array from within the results nested object in Argyle for each respective endpoint, so we don't need to parse that on our side.

[^paintbrush_example.json]
[^Paintbrush Journey Example.postman_collection.json]
[^Alloy Webhook Journey Events.zip]

There are a few things about our API / the Postman collection that I wanted to call out specifically:

* The collection does include an example of the PUT request that would be involved for uploading documents to the application - however, if you'll be using Alloy's SDK for document collection, then this PUT request would be performed by the SDK automatically, so this is just for reference and testing
** If you use the last name of¬†KYC_DOB_NOT_VERIFIED for any of the individuals in the Journey Application request, this should trigger step up to the document verification node. There's a webhook event for this, and it's also available in the Journey Application response body

* I also included an example of the /entities API, which is not required for you all to use, but I think it may be helpful. There are some instances where you're able to use an external_entity_id in requests, but in other scenarios,¬†only the Alloy entity_token is supported right now. This specifically applies to both webhook event request bodies, and the PUT endpoint, but I've submitted feature requests to Product for us to support¬†{{external_entity_id}}¬†everywhere, so this may change soon.
In the interim, to make things a bit easier, you can use the /entities API to generate an Alloy entity token, and maintain a mapping of the External Entity ID <> Alloy Token rather than having to hit the GET /entities endpoint to do a lookup.

* In the example POST request to create a new Journey application, I've included a value for the¬†external_group_id field - this is optional, but if you have an identifier for the Paintbrush application as a whole, then you can use this field.

* There's an optional request header that you can include on the POST /applications called alloy-journey-application-sync - if you include this header, you will receive a synchronous API response to get the entire status of the Journey after completing the POST (equivalent to what's in the GET /applications request). However, if you include this header, Alloy will still send webhook notification events (assuming there's an endpoint set up to receive them) for the Journey application.","23/–∏—é–Ω/22 4:56 PM;5a97faed1df57331bfe56e3e;UPD: comment from Kaela:



* Alloy will only ever request an ID, not any other type of document (I previously had proof of address as an example)
